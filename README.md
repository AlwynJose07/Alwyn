PC Building Helper Bot

Description:
This project introduces the **PC Building Helper Bot**, an innovative tool designed to assist enthusiasts and beginners alike in assembling their custom PC builds. Utilizing UiPath, this bot simplifies the process of selecting compatible PC components, manages budget constraints, and provides step-by-step guidance during the assembly process. Whether you are building a high-end gaming rig or a budget-friendly workstation, this bot aims to enhance your building experience, ensuring you get the best possible outcomes tailored to your needs.

 Abstract :
My  project introduces an automated PC building assistant designed to help users create a customized PC configuration within a specified budget. The system prompts the user to input their budget, allocates the budget into predefined ratios for keycomponents (Processor, Motherboard, RAM, SSD, PSU), and selects the optimal quantity of each component based on current market prices. The resulting configuration is then written to a notepad file. The program incorporates functionalities such as user input handling, budget allocation, component selection, and file manipulation. Additionally, the system utilizes email capabilities to notify users of their configured PC by sending the notepad file as an attachment. The email feature relies on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending notifications.  This project serves as a valuable tool for individuals seeking an efficient and budget-conscious approach to building a custom PC. The automated process streamlines the configuration process, providing users with a convenient and comprehensive solution for planning their PC build.
